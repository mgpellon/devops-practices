# Production Library and Readiness

This project contains a library of blueprints and designs, and their outcome 
- production readiness review.

## Overview

The Infrastructure Library contains a snapshot in time of our thinking about 
the problems we are solving. This happens through two stages:

1. We begin with **blueprints**, which define and scope a problem and provide 
options on how we might approach said problem.

2. The **design** stage, which fleshes out the approach and provides the technical 
design on the solution.

Once we have executed on the design, we create a production readiness review 
whenever there is a significant change to **<APP_NAME>** infrastructure. This may 
be a new service, a new feature, or a major infrastructure change.

After completing the readiness review, we update the relevant architectural 
and/or operational documentation.
